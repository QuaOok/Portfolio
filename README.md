## 1. Crack Growth Measurement System  

**Overview:**  
This project involves developing a system to automatically measure the crack growth rate of glass samples for Corning.  

**Key Features:**  
- Designed a system that reads real-time load cell data and controls a stepper motor to apply forces ranging from 100g to 1500g.  
- Integrated limit switches to ensure safe and reliable motor operation by preventing over-travel.  
- Enhanced test accuracy and repeatability through automated load control.  

**My Role:**  
- Collaborated with a team of 8 as the embedded engineer.  
- Responsible for designing the MCU-based hardware platform and developing firmware.  
- Developed precision control algorithms to achieve force control within a 0.25% error margin.  

**Achievements:**  
- Provided an efficient and precise testing environment compared to manual methods.  
- Delivered a stable and reliable system tailored to Corningâ€™s research needs.  

**Tech Stack:**  
`ESP32`, `Stepper Motor`, `Load Cell`, `C`, `Embedded Software Development`

## 2. Microcontroller Systems Course Project - Ping Pong Game  

**Overview:**  
A final project for a microcontroller systems course, where two STM32 microcontrollers communicate via UART to implement a ping-pong game.  

**Key Features:**  
- Displayed the game interface using an LCD screen.  
- Synchronized two MCUs using UART communication for seamless gameplay.  
- Incorporated button inputs for game control and score tracking.  

**My Role:**  
- Collaborated with a team of 2 and led the implementation of the UART communication protocol and LCD display.  
- Designed and optimized real-time data exchange and game logic.  

**Achievements:**  
- Achieved smooth and reliable communication for uninterrupted gameplay.  
- Strengthened skills in embedded systems design and software integration.  

**Tech Stack:**  
`STM32`, `C`, `UART`,`SPI`, `ADC&DAC`, `LCD Display`
