## 1. Crack Growth Measurement System  

**Overview:**  
This project involves developing a system to automatically measure the crack growth rate of glass samples for Corning.  

**Key Features:**  
- Designed a system that reads real-time load cell data and controls a stepper motor to apply forces ranging from 100g to 1500g.  
- Integrated limit switches to ensure safe and reliable motor operation by preventing over-travel.  
- Enhanced test accuracy and repeatability through automated load control.  

**My Role:**  
- Collaborated with a team of 8 as the embedded engineer.  
- Responsible for designing the MCU-based hardware platform and developing firmware.  
- Developed precision control algorithms to achieve force control within a 0.25% error margin.  

**Achievements:**  
- Provided an efficient and precise testing environment compared to manual methods.  
- Delivered a stable and reliable system tailored to Corningâ€™s research needs.  

**Tech Stack:**  
`ESP32`, `Stepper Motor`, `Load Cell`, `C`, `Embedded Software Development`
